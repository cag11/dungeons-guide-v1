# 🎃 Halloween Stings By The Shrieks From Its Wings

## 📜 The Story of Halloween

**Halloween gets its name,**  
**from the demons that played a game.**  
**A game that had sacrifices with song,**  
**songs that would bring monsters along.**

**The monsters would then circle around a camp,**  
**monsters like skeletons, werewolves and vamps.**  
**They would chant a great song for their lord,**  
**so that he would rise and kill the humans with his sword.**

**Upon his back were huge wings,**  
**wings that would also sing.**  
**They shrieked out a fine tune that made ears bleed,**  
**all that was good would die and sprout the seeds...**

**The seeds of the great pumpkins that grew on Halloween,**  
**the pumpkins that would grow from organs like the spleen.**  
**Pumpkins that would grow and give birth to great power,**  
**power that would shoot out of their flowers.**

**There would also be clouds of pollen that was created,**  
**to trick the humans and keep them separated.**  
**All of this was done on Halloween,**  
**for evil needs to rise and wipe the Earth clean.**
