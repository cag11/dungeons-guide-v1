### Playing/Grinding:

You kill/Grow by utilizing the reach keeping a distance from mobs as much as you can, you hide behind cover and walls to pull them down and get the enemy along this will keep any knockback side mob away but if you're facing a threat and pushed back you move back with the mob keeping it at the edge of your reach and you pull out of their reach.

### Best Enchants:
