## 📊 Spear Info

![Spear](../assets/melee/Spear_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } / ![Fortune Spear](../assets/melee/Fortune_Spear_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } / ![Whispering Spear](../assets/melee/Whispering_Spear_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } are all incredible weapons with the highest reach in game allowing you to keep mobs at bay with ![Gravity](../assets/enhancements/Gravity.webp){ width="32" } for some of the highest survivability in game.

### Best unique:

![Whispering Spear](../assets/melee/Whispering_Spear_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } is the best unique in the line, although it's just ![Echo](../assets/enhancements/Echo.webp){ width="32" } it does help with the pushback of the weapon allowing it to keep mobs away slightly better though Spear is great from simply being Spear.

### Playstyle:

You use Spears by utilizing the reach keeping a distance from mobs as much as you can, you hide behind cover and walls to put them in-between you and the enemy, doing this will keep any knockback able mob away but if you’re facing a threat not pushed back you move with the mob keeping it at the edge of your reach and yourself out of their reach.

### Best Enchants:

![Gravity](../assets/enhancements/Gravity.webp){ width="32" } is the entire core of the weapon, it singlehandedly puts it up multiple tiers by allowing it to group up and keep mobs at bay as it pulls mobs into the impact of your weapon, this also helps the AoE area.

![Void Strike](../assets/enhancements/Void_Strike.webp){ width="32" } is the best damage enchant for it being 98.6% extra dps at base 86.3% extra dps with MAS, 56.3% extra dps with ![Mushroom](../assets/artifacts/Death_Cap_Mushroom_(MCD).webp){ width="32" }, and 48.1% extra dps with ![Mushroom](../assets/artifacts/Death_Cap_Mushroom_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } and MAS.
(MAS refers to the armor perk +25% Melee Attack Speed)
(This does not include the first hit which applies ![Void Strike](../assets/enhancements/Void_Strike.webp){ width="32" }).

Though adding the speed from ![Mushroom](../assets/artifacts/Death_Cap_Mushroom_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } and MAS help perform better with more pushback and is more dps overall.

![Unchanting](../assets/enhancements/Unchanting.webp){ width="32" } is the next best damage enchant if you're on Apoc+ especially higher ones as it's 100% extra dps so enchanted mobs, your biggest threat on the difficulty.

![Critical Hit](../assets/enhancements/Critical_Hit.webp){ width="32" } is 40% extra dps overall, though it can overkill and matter less Spear doesn't suffer enough to invalidate it.

![Committed](../assets/enhancements/Committed.webp){ width="32" } is basically a sidegrade to ![Critical Hit](../assets/enhancements/Critical_Hit.webp){ width="32" } not activating on the first hit but being more consistent on following hits, it's about 35%-40% dps itself so overkill included on ![Critical Hit](../assets/enhancements/Critical_Hit.webp){ width="32" } they do about the same, ![Committed](../assets/enhancements/Committed.webp){ width="32" } more to a boss.

![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } is simply 9% of your dps as healing after you kill a mob, although the weapon is defensive enough to be able to pass with even a ![Anima Conduit](../assets/enhancements/Anima_Conduit.webp){ width="32" } tranged this is what you'd use if you need melee healing.

![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } is simply just 50% damage reduction for 4 seconds upon a kill always halving the damage you take. Spear is already defensive but this can help when things go bad or against ranged mobs which can hit you or ![Thorns](../assets/enhancements/Thorns.webp){ width="32" } which will damage you for melee damage done.

### Honorable mentions/still solid Enchants:

![Exploding](../assets/enhancements/Exploding.webp){ width="32" } upon kill mobs will explode for 60% of their health as damage, with ![Gravity](../assets/enhancements/Gravity.webp){ width="32" } Spear groups melts up into an area so this can hit multiple mobs, it also has knockback which can further help keep them at bay though the knockback Spear already has can make it less predictable in where ![Exploding](../assets/enhancements/Exploding.webp){ width="32" } will go.

![Weakening](../assets/enhancements/Weakening.webp){ width="32" } is 40% direct damage reduction to whatever you hit and it is nearly a hit for 5 seconds. Spear groups up mobs so this will all hit a lot though it doesn't against ![Electrified](../assets/enhancements/Electrified.webp){ width="32" }, ![Burning](../assets/enhancements/Burning.webp){ width="32" }, ![Thorns](../assets/enhancements/Thorns.webp){ width="32" } etc damage.

![Refreshment](../assets/enhancements/Refreshment_Melee_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } reduces your Potion cooldown by 3 seconds upon kill, Spear isn't a beatstick large area melee so it doesn't benefit as much as something that can kill faster would but with //Potion Coolwon it wouldn't be the worst.

![Pain Cycle](../assets/enhancements/Pain_Cycle_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } if lined up to land on the final hit in every other combo will be 90.0% extra dps however if it gets misaligned the dps will instead be 54.5%, ![Whispering Spear](../assets/melee/Whispering_Spear_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } with ![Echo](../assets/enhancements/Echo.webp){ width="32" } will also misalign it by itself and the boost is additive meaning it only stacks by adding together rather than multiplying by the percent like the others mentioned

![Pain Cycle](../assets/enhancements/Pain_Cycle_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } also takes away 3% health every activation hit (doesn't for the actual hit, 2.5% health on average per attack) so will take up some of your healing.
