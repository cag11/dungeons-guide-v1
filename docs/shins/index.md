## 🧠 Teaching Philosophy

Shin's guides focus on **game understanding** rather than just build lists. The goal is simple: **turn you from a guide-follower into someone who understands the system**.

Instead of just telling you "use this build," Shin explains:
- **Why** enchantments work the way they do
- **How** damage scaling actually functions
- **What** makes a build Apocalypse-ready

- Why does this enchantment combo work?
- How do I adapt builds instead of just copying them?

## 🔥 Core Approach

### 📖 Step-by-Step Teaching
- Starts with **"What is this?"** before **"How do I use it?"**
- Breaks complex mechanics into digestible pieces
- Avoids assuming deep prior knowledge

### 🧱 Apocalypse-Ready Builds
- Focuses on **scalable, survivable** strategies
- Builds work under pressure, not just in theory
- Frames builds as **foundations** you can adapt

### 🔄 Reusable Knowledge
- Teaches systems, not just solutions
- Helps you understand **why** something fails or succeeds
- Makes you independent instead of guide-dependent
