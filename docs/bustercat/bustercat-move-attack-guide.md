1. **Hold** the melee attack button
2. **Click** light feather milliseconds after (ideally)
3. **Let go** of the attack button mid-air or before you touch the ground
4. You can now **move around** or **dodge projectiles** while waiting for the anchor to land

**Requirements:**
- At least **2 mobs nearby** 
- **Burst Bowstring** enchantment
- **Light Feather** artifact

### For Non-Host Players

If you aren't the host, the timing is different:

1. **Click** the melee button
2. **Use feather** right after
3. **No need** for Burst Bowstring or even a feather for basic movement
