## Armor

**Best armor options for melee-focused builds**

### ![Wither Armor](../assets/armor/Wither_Armor_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Wither Armor

- Lifesteal aura (heals you for 6% of your weapon's direct damage (so enchants like ![Shockwave](../assets/enhancements/Shockwave.webp){ width="32" } Shockwave, ![Swirling](../assets/enhancements/T_Swirling_Icon.webp){ width="32" } Swirling or ![Thundering](../assets/enhancements/Thundering.webp){ width="32" } Thundering don't fuel it, if you're using lifesteal armor, these are the enchants you want to avoid, also it's an **aura**, meaning that your allies also benefit from it)
- +35% Damage reduction

### ![Spider Armor](../assets/armor/Spider_Armor_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Spider Armor

- Lifesteal aura
- +25% faster attack speed

### ![Renegade Armor](../assets/armor/Renegade_Armor_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Renegade Armor

- +20% weapon damage boost aura
- +25% faster attack speed
- +35% damage reduction

**Enchantments**

![Cooldown](../assets/enhancements/Cool_Down.webp){ width="32" } **Cooldown** - **mandatory**, allows for infinite deathcap mushroom and iron hide amulet at high power levels

![Potion Barrier](../assets/enhancements/Potion_Barrier.webp){ width="32" } **Potion barrier** - **very good**, gives you 90% DR for 9 seconds every time your health potion is used, very strong when paired with ![Refreshment](../assets/enhancements/Refreshment_Melee_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Refreshment

![Deflecting](../assets/enhancements/Deflect.webp){ width="32" } **Deflecting** - **very good**, has a 45% to block 100% damage from incoming projectiles and deflect them to their source

![Chilling](../assets/enhancements/Chilling.webp){ width="32" } **Chilling** - **very good**, slows enemies (Triggers every 2 seconds)

![Snowball](../assets/enhancements/Snowball_(Dungeons).webp){ width="32" } **Snowball** - **very good**, stuns one enemy for 1 second every second (it can save you in close meetings with creepers)

![Death Barter](../assets/enhancements/Death_Barter.webp){ width="32" } **Death barter** - **good**, allows you to respawn with 100% health, the downside of it is that discards everything you earned during the mission, it's not the best possible option for builds focusing on not dying at all (melee/tank builds)

![Cowardice](../assets/enhancements/Cowardice.webp){ width="32" } **Cowardice** - **good**, if you have full HP, you deal 40% more damage, melee builds take a lot of damage but with solid healing it's a good DPS booster

![Surprise Gift](../assets/enhancements/Surprise_Gift.webp){ width="32" } **Surprise gift** - **only in specific builds**, you have 50% chance to create a random consumable item, but that also could be used by itself, but combined with ![Refreshment](../assets/enhancements/Refreshment_Melee_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Refreshment it can be really helpful, often used alongside ![Potion Barrier](../assets/enhancements/Potion_Barrier.webp){ width="32" } Potion Barrier **in health potion spam builds**

![Reckless](../assets/enhancements/Reckless_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } **Reckless** - **only in specific builds**, you have 40% less HP, but deal 90% more damage, it should be used only in builds with a lot of damage reduction

---

## Ranged Weapons

Your ranged weapon doesn't really matter in melee builds, you could preferably use a one-shot bow (elite power bow with enchants like ![Overcharge](../assets/enhancements/Over-Charge_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } + ![Supercharge](../assets/enhancements/Supercharge.webp){ width="32" } + ![Growing](../assets/enhancements/Growing.webp){ width="32" }) to easily clear out stronger enemies or an imploding crossbow with ![Refreshment](../assets/enhancements/Refreshment_Ranged_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Refreshment to utilise potion enchants like barrier more effectively
