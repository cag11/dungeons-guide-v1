# Melee Weapons - Fast

Faster weapons no longer benefit from ![Voidstrike](../assets/enhancements/Void_Strike.webp){ width="32" } Voidstrike (since it gets outclassed by other options) or ![Weakening](../assets/enhancements/Weakening.webp){ width="32" } Weakening (in case of the low aoe weapons) and have a much more unique playstyle. A very good option is always ![Ambush](../assets/enhancements/Ambush.webp){ width="32" } Ambush paired with ![Stunning](../assets/enhancements/Stunning.webp){ width="32" } Stunning, this combo provides +60% physical damage and nearly permanently stuns enemies on weapons fast enough (contrary to popular belief, ![Stunning](../assets/enhancements/Stunning.webp){ width="32" } Stunning isn't made obsolete by "mob stun resistance"), ![Unchanting](../assets/enhancements/Unchanting.webp){ width="32" } Unchanting is still very good at +100% physical DPS, just like ![Gravity](../assets/enhancements/Gravity.webp){ width="32" } Gravity (fast often goes in pair with low area of effect) and ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Guarding Strike. Another very interesting possibility is ![Thundering](../assets/enhancements/Thundering.webp){ width="32" } Thundering, which adds a ton of indirect damage that can be further amplified by ![Lightning Focus](../assets/enhancements/LightningFocus_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Lightning Focus (up to +115% added DPS). Healing on fast weapons can be executed the same way as on their slower counterparts or with ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } Radiance.

## ![Rapier](../assets/melee/Rapier_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Rapiers*

![Gravity](../assets/enhancements/Gravity.webp){ width="32" } + ![Stunning](../assets/enhancements/Stunning.webp){ width="32" } + ![Ambush](../assets/enhancements/Ambush.webp){ width="32" } / ![Thundering](../assets/enhancements/Thundering.webp){ width="32" } + ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } / ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } / ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } / ![Exploding](../assets/enhancements/Exploding.webp){ width="32" }

(![Thundering](../assets/enhancements/Thundering.webp){ width="32" } is often mutually exclusive with ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } and should be used with ![Lightning Focus](../assets/enhancements/LightningFocus_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } most of the time)

Many people rank rapiers as very weak due to their comparably low DPS, the truth is that they're the fastest weapons in the game, while still having a good reach. This allows them to permastun mobs while keeping them away from you.

## ![Fighter's Bindings](../assets/melee/Fighters_Bindings_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Fighter's Bindings

![Gravity](../assets/enhancements/Gravity.webp){ width="32" } + ![Stunning](../assets/enhancements/Stunning.webp){ width="32" } + ![Ambush](../assets/enhancements/Ambush.webp){ width="32" } / ![Thundering](../assets/enhancements/Thundering.webp){ width="32" } + ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } / ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } / ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } / ![Exploding](../assets/enhancements/Exploding.webp){ width="32" }

**or**

![Shockwave](../assets/enhancements/Shockwave.webp){ width="32" } + ![Swirling](../assets/enhancements/T_Swirling_Icon.webp){ width="32" } + ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } + ![Thundering](../assets/enhancements/Thundering.webp){ width="32" } (remember that this is a lot of indirect damage)

## ![Mechanized Sawblade](../assets/melee/Mechanized_Sawblade_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Mechanized Sawblade*

![Gravity](../assets/enhancements/Gravity.webp){ width="32" } + ![Unchanting](../assets/enhancements/Unchanting.webp){ width="32" } + ![Critical Hit](../assets/enhancements/Critical_Hit.webp){ width="32" } + ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } / ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } / ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" }

**or**

![Shockwave](../assets/enhancements/Shockwave.webp){ width="32" } + ![Swirling](../assets/enhancements/T_Swirling_Icon.webp){ width="32" } + ![Unchanting](../assets/enhancements/Unchanting.webp){ width="32" } + ![Critical Hit](../assets/enhancements/Critical_Hit.webp){ width="32" } (healing is a limiting factor)

**or**

![Dynamo](../assets/enhancements/DynamoMelee.webp){ width="32" } / ![Pain Cycle](../assets/enhancements/Pain_Cycle_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } + ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } + ![Gravity](../assets/enhancements/Gravity.webp){ width="32" }

Mechanized Sawblades are probably the most unique weapons in the game, their combo can be exploited by holding down missing the first attack with loaded ![Pain Cycle](../assets/enhancements/Pain_Cycle_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Pain Cycle, ![Artifact Synergy](../assets/enhancements/Artifact_Synergy_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Artifact Synergy or ![Dynamo](../assets/enhancements/DynamoMelee.webp){ width="32" } Dynamo which causes the effect to apply for the whole combo. Another exploit is spam attacking to trigger ![Shockwave](../assets/enhancements/Shockwave.webp){ width="32" } ![Swirling](../assets/enhancements/T_Swirling_Icon.webp){ width="32" } constantly.
