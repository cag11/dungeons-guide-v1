# ![Final Shout](../assets/enhancements/Final_Shout.webp){ width="32" } Final Shout Has Never Been an Alternative to ![Cooldown](../assets/enhancements/Cool_Down.webp){ width="32" } Cooldown

At the first sight, ![Final Shout](../assets/enhancements/Final_Shout.webp){ width="32" } Final Shout seems like a very useful enchant, it triggers all of your artifacts when you need them the most... only when you need them the most. 

## The Problem

That's right, ![Final Shout](../assets/enhancements/Final_Shout.webp){ width="32" } triggers only in a crisis situation, which should not happen in the first place (if your melee build is losing HP enough for ![Final Shout](../assets/enhancements/Final_Shout.webp){ width="32" } Final Shout to trigger somewhat reliably, you should head to my melee build guide and read it), even if you somehow managed to trigger it regularly, it's still basically ![Cooldown](../assets/enhancements/Cool_Down.webp){ width="32" } but less reliable. 

Why would you even need to trigger artifacts when in danger? For melee builds, ![Iron Hide Amulet](../assets/artifacts/Iron_Hide_Amulet_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Iron Hide and ![Deathcap Mushroom](../assets/artifacts/Death_Cap_Mushroom_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Deathcap are probably the most used and effective artifacts, with ![Cooldown](../assets/enhancements/Cool_Down.webp){ width="32" } Cooldown, they're infinite on apocalypse +25 and all other build types spam artifacts like crazy, whether it's thanks to soul artifacts having nearly no cooldown or due to rolling bows clearing any cooldown immediately.

## Summary

In summary: ![Final Shout](../assets/enhancements/Final_Shout.webp){ width="32" } is outclassed by ![Cooldown](../assets/enhancements/Cool_Down.webp){ width="32" } on melee builds and ![Burst Bowstring](../assets/enhancements/Burst_Bowstring.webp){ width="32" } ![Cooldown Shot](../assets/enhancements/Cooldown_Shot_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } ![Light Feather](../assets/artifacts/Light_Feather_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } on rolling builds, while trying to serve a nonexistent purpose.
