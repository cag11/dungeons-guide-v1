## MELEE WEAPON ENCHANTMENTS

### ![Void Strike](../assets/enhancements/Void_Strike.webp){ width="32" } Void Strike
**RANK:** S **TYPE:** DPS

Applies a damage multiplier that grows over time, this means that it's considerably better on slower weapons. The buff ranges from +25% on very fast weapons up to +175% on very slow ones.

**Uses:**
- Every weapon faster or as fast as a tempest knife receives over +40% DPS, which outclasses every other DPS booster when it comes to all enemies.
- Some builds utilize void strike along with jungle poison, due to the latter not taking it off when dealing damage, which leads to very high damage output

### ![Unchanting](../assets/enhancements/Unchanting.webp){ width="32" } Unchanting
**RANK:** S **TYPE:** DPS

+100% physical damage against enchanted mobs

**Uses:**
- Very helpful in higher difficulties when enchanted mobs are very numerous and the most dangerous, a good choice for every weapon.

### ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } Leeching
**RANK:** S **TYPE:** HEALING

Every mob killed with physical damage heals you for 9% of it's max health

**Uses:**
- Builds that don't rely too much on indirect damage (which "steals" kills from leeching) can use leeching as a subside for the lifesteal aura, it's healing is better than radiance but needs kills to trigger, which can sometimes make it unreliable.

### ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } Radiance
**RANK:** S **TYPE:** HEALING

Every hit has a 20% chance to trigger healing

**Uses:**
- A healing alternative that does not need physical damage to activate, matches leeching on faster weapons.

### ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Guarding Strike
**RANK:** S **TYPE:** DEFENSE

Each physical damage kill grants 50% DR as a player status effect (which means that it doesn't diminish with other DR sources)

**Uses:**
- Reliable non-diminishing DR source, works well as long as there is not too much indirect damage

---

### ![Weakening](../assets/enhancements/Weakening.webp){ width="32" } Weakening
**RANK:** S **TYPE:** DEFENSE

Hitting an enemy with physical damageinflicts a status effect reducing their damage by 40% (which translates to 40% player DR against affected mobs), diminishes with the gong of weakening (since they're both mob debuffs)

**Uses:**
- All weapons with good AoE benefit from weakening, as long as they don't oneshot most of the enemies (like rolling build anchors)
