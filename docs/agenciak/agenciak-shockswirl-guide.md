# ![Shockwave](../assets/enhancements/Shockwave.webp){ width="32" } ![Swirling](../assets/enhancements/T_Swirling_Icon.webp){ width="32" } Shockswirl Is Not a Good AoE Boost

The well known ![Shockwave](../assets/enhancements/Shockwave.webp){ width="32" } Shockwave and ![Swirling](../assets/enhancements/T_Swirling_Icon.webp){ width="32" } Swirling enchantments have once been the meta for ![Fighter's Bindings](../assets/melee/Fighters_Bindings_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Fighter's Bindings (which has lost its splendor following the final update), ever since, many people began the habit of putting it on everything, completely ignoring how they work (or rather, why they don't). 

## The Problems

First of all, to even trigger an activation you need to finish your attack combo, meaning that the DPS boost relies on your weapon's combo length, immediately making it a poor choice for... well anything that doesn't have an extremely short combo (so ![Fighter's Bindings](../assets/melee/Fighters_Bindings_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Fighter's Bindings and ![Mechanized Sawblade](../assets/melee/Mechanized_Sawblade_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Mechanized Sawblade, when spam attacking). 

Furthermore, both enchants are indirect damage, meaning that they don't proc ![Refreshment](../assets/enhancements/Refreshment_Melee_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Refreshment, ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Guarding Strike, ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } Leeching and don't get buffed by physical damage multipliers (such as ![Unchanting](../assets/enhancements/Unchanting.webp){ width="32" } Unchanting or ![Critical Hit](../assets/enhancements/Critical_Hit.webp){ width="32" } Critical Hit). 

If that wasn't enough, the damage dealt is comparably very low and spread out, your median average melee weapon is capable of reaching 10 million DPS (apocalypse +25), shockswirl not only won't trigger per second due to combo length on most weapons, but even when it will, it'd deal miniscule damage in comparison.

## Summary

In summary: ![Shockwave](../assets/enhancements/Shockwave.webp){ width="32" } ![Swirling](../assets/enhancements/T_Swirling_Icon.webp){ width="32" } relies on your weapon's combo length, deals indirect damage and is just a comparably very low DPS boost.
