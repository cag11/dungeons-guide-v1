# Best Method for Healing

## ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } Radiance, ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } Leeching and the Best Method for Healing

To beat a mission you need 2 things; staying alive and making your enemies do the opposite. To achieve these goals, you need a mix of damage, defense and sustain, no matter how much do you exceed in any category, you always need to fulfill these 3 basic needs.

## The Useless Healing Methods

There are various methods of healing that depend on your build, but first of all, the useless ones: ![Totem of Regeneration](../assets/artifacts/Totem_of_Regeneration_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Totem of Regeneration, ![Soul Healer](../assets/artifacts/Soul_Healer_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Soul Healer and ![Explorer](../assets/enhancements/Explorer.webp){ width="32" } Explorer. Each of them heals too little too rarely, while ![Soul Healer](../assets/artifacts/Soul_Healer_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Soul Healer gets outclassed by ![Anima Conduit](../assets/enhancements/Anima_Conduit.webp){ width="32" } Anima Conduit in any soul build.

I cannot emphasize how much **passive healing** is needed, if you're fighting constantly, you have to heal constantly, not every few seconds, since that's how you get overwhelmed even with good defense.

## The Best Healing Methods

That's why ![Wither Armor](../assets/armor/Wither_Armor_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Wither Armor and ![Spider Armor](../assets/armor/Spider_Armor_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Spider Armor are so adored, they have something called lifeboost aura, which means that 6% of your physical damage output is converted to healing, it's probably the best healing method for melee builds, but it's not the only one.

![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } Leeching and ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } Radiance keep many melee builds afloat, ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } Leeching is considerably stronger at higher DPS while ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } Radiance dominates its niche of very fast (and lower DPS) weapons, remember that ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } Leeching is universal but gets negated by indirect damage (artifacts, ![Thundering](../assets/enhancements/Thundering.webp){ width="32" } Thundering or ![Encrusted Anchor](../assets/melee/Encrusted_Anchor_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } / ![Vine Whip](../assets/melee/Vine_Whip_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Jungle Poison, etc.).

![Anima Conduit](../assets/enhancements/Anima_Conduit.webp){ width="32" } Anima Conduit is a must-have in every single soul build, since it achieves insane healing rates with proper soul gain. ![Health Synergy](../assets/enhancements/Health_Synergy.webp){ width="32" } Health Synergy fuels rolling builds, which focus on spamming the ![Light Feather](../assets/artifacts/Light_Feather_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Light Feather artifact (and often other artifacts too, in a mage build), it's a reliable healing source for any artifact based build.

Another rare option is ![Radiance Shot](../assets/enhancements/Radiance_Shot.webp){ width="32" } Radiance Shot, which works surprisingly well on ![Harp Crossbow](../assets/ranged/Harp_Crossbow_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Harp Crossbow and ![Winter's Touch](../assets/ranged/Winter's_Touch_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Winter's Touch (with a rolling setup), it's very useful when you can't afford to sacrifice a slot for healing anywhere else.

## Summary

In summary: ![Soul Healer](../assets/artifacts/Soul_Healer_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } ![Totem of Regeneration](../assets/artifacts/Totem_of_Regeneration_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } ![Explorer](../assets/enhancements/Explorer.webp){ width="32" } aren't regular or powerful enough to meet your needs and they all get outclassed by ![Wither Armor](../assets/armor/Wither_Armor_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } ![Leeching](../assets/enhancements/Leeching.webp){ width="32" } ![Radiance](../assets/enhancements/Radiance.webp){ width="32" } (<- only on very fast weapons!) or ![Anima Conduit](../assets/enhancements/Anima_Conduit.webp){ width="32" }
