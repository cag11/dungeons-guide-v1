# ![Protection](../assets/enhancements/Protection.webp){ width="32" } Protection Isn't Worth It

Many people see protection, with its "powerful" tag and immediately choose it for their armor... which is a huge mistake. 

Protection is not only a mere **+15% DR** (compared to 30% from ![Chilling](../assets/enhancements/Chilling.webp){ width="32" } Chilling, 50% from ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Guarding Strike or 40% from ![Weakening](../assets/enhancements/Weakening.webp){ width="32" } Weakening), but it also loses value (unlike many other enchants, which are for example enemy DMG debuffs or player status effects), when paired just with ![Iron Hide Amulet](../assets/artifacts/Iron_Hide_Amulet_(MCD).webp){ width="32" } Iron Hide and 35%, protection falls to only **6.5%** and this value goes down even more with every other DR source.

## Alternatives

Alternatives include ![Chilling](../assets/enhancements/Chilling.webp){ width="32" } Chilling (+30% mob HPS debuff), ![Deflect](../assets/enhancements/Deflect.webp){ width="32" } Deflecting (+45% ranged DR) or ![Potion Barrier](../assets/enhancements/Potion_Barrier.webp){ width="32" } Potion Barrier (+90% status effect DR), other good DR sources include ![Weakening](../assets/enhancements/Weakening.webp){ width="32" } Weakening (+40% mob debuff DR, can be put on a support ranged weapon), ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } Guarding Strike (+50% status effect DR) or even the 35% built-in armor damage reduction.

## Summary

In summary: ![Potion Barrier](../assets/enhancements/Potion_Barrier.webp){ width="32" } ![Guarding Strike](../assets/enhancements/Guarding_Strike_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="32" } ![Chilling](../assets/enhancements/Chilling.webp){ width="32" } is **+96.5% DR**, adding ![Protection](../assets/enhancements/Protection.webp){ width="32" } into this mix brings this number up by a decimal point.
