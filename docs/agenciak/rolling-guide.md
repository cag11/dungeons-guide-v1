# Beginner's Guide - Rolling builds

## What is a "rolling build"?

The core of it being rolling build is ![Burstbowstring](../assets/enhancements/Burst_Bowstring.webp){ width="24" } Burstbowstring paired with ![Cooldown Shot](../assets/enhancements/Cooldown_Shot_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="24" } Cooldown shot and a ![Light Feather](../assets/artifacts/Light_Feather_(MCD).webp){ width="24" } Light feather, how does it work? ![Burstbowstring](../assets/enhancements/Burst_Bowstring.webp){ width="24" } Burstbowstring triggers every time you roll, shooting out 1 fully charged arrow per enemy (up to 3 arrows), each of them triggers ![Cooldown Shot](../assets/enhancements/Cooldown_Shot_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="24" } Cooldownshot speeding up your artifact cooldown 1.5s per charged shot, ![Light Feather](../assets/artifacts/Light_Feather_(MCD).webp){ width="24" } Light feather has a 3s cooldown, which means that you get to roll constantly shooting 3 charged arrows (which shortens your cooldown by 4.5s, allowing for a second roll using the feather right after) every time you do it with the only condition being close to at least 2 enemies

Remember that you need a ton of arrows for it to work, that's why you need ![Looting](../assets/enhancements/Looting.webp){ width="24" } Looting or ![Infinity](../assets/enhancements/Infinity.webp){ width="24" } Infinity

## Ranged Weapon

**Best options for a rolling bow**

### <img src="../assets/ranged/Winter's_Touch_(MCD).webp" width="24" alt="Winter's Touch" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Winter's Touch
*If your build uses any quiver artifacts, this is what you're looking for*

- Shoots out 3 arrows when charged (In a rolling build it means 9 arrows for every roll, because 3 arrows per 1 shot and ![Burstbowstring](../assets/enhancements/Burst_Bowstring.webp){ width="24" } Burstbowstring provides 3 shots)
- Slows down hit enemies

### ![Pink Scoundrel](../assets/ranged/The_Pink_Scoundrel_(MCD).webp){ width="24" } Pink Scoundrel
- ricochets after hitting an enemy
- has a chance to "enrage" mobs (makes them attack everything instead of focusing on the player, other enemies, passive animals but still can target players)

### ![Bubble Burster](../assets/ranged/Bubble_Burster_(MCD).webp){ width="24" } Bubble Burster
- ricochets after hitting an enemy
- traps enemies in bubbles

## Enchantments

![Burstbowstring](../assets/enhancements/Burst_Bowstring.webp){ width="24" } **Burstbowstring** - **mandatory**

![Cooldown Shot](../assets/enhancements/Cooldown_Shot_(MCD_Enchantment).webp){ width="24" } **Cooldown shot** - **mandatory**

![Infinity](../assets/enhancements/Infinity.webp){ width="24" } **Infinity** - if you use quivers, has a chance to not use up your arrow

![Looting](../assets/enhancements/Looting.webp){ width="24" } **Looting** - if you don't use quivers,

![Multishot](../assets/enhancements/Multishot.webp){ width="24" } **Multishot** - if you use <img src="../assets/ranged/Winter's_Touch_(MCD).webp" width="24" alt="Winter's Touch" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Winter's touch, has a 40% to turn each arrow you shoot out into 5 projectiles, it's very effective on <img src="../assets/ranged/Winter's_Touch_(MCD).webp" width="24" alt="Winter's Touch" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Winter's touch, because it shoots out 3 arrows (meaning each of them has a 40% chance for it activate)

![Tempo Theft](../assets/enhancements/Tempo_Theft.webp){ width="24" } **Tempo theft** - **good**, slows down enemies and speeds you up

![Wild Rage](../assets/enhancements/Wild_Rage.webp){ width="24" } **Wild rage** - **good**, enrages mobs
