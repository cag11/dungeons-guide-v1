Here you will find useful terms and definitions explained in detail

## DEFENSE

**Damage Reduction (DR)** - the percentage value by which received damage is reduced (you can find specific DR values in the compendium)
- formula: DR=1-1/EHP
- example: 100 damage taken with 20% DR turns into 80 damage

**Damage Negation (DN)** - the chance of fully negating received damage
- example: 100 damage taken with 30% DN gives a 30% chance of the damage "missing"

**mob debuff DR** - status effect inflicted on a mob that reduces it's DPS, calculated in DR and does not diminish with DR sources different than other mob debuffs

**Effective Health Points (EHP)** - modifier used to convert health increase into DR or vice versa
- formula: EHP=1x2(DR/1-DR)
- example: 50% DR is 2x EHP, which means that twice as much damage has to be taken for the health loss to be proportional

## DAMAGE

**Physical damage** - damage dealt by melee or ranged weapon hits, influenced by enchants like unchanting, critical hit or committed

**Flat physical damage modifier** - buffs that apply a physical damage multiplier to the base damage without interacting with each other, which means that they're first added together and then the damage is multiplied by the total
- examples: reckless, overcharge, shadow form, all built-in armor damage buffs

**Indirect damage** - non-physical damage that does not activate enchants like guarding strike or leeching on kill, some of them get buffed by elemental focuses (poison, lightning, fire, soul)
- examples: shockwave, exploding, all elemental damage

**Full damage multipliers (mob debuffs)** - status effects inflicted on mobs that cause them to receive greater damage
- examples: gong of weakening, void strike

## MISCELLANEOUS

**3-6 +25 trial** - refers to tier III daily trial with 6 collected banner modifiers (3 threat and 3 mystery, obtained from raid captains found in some missions) on the difficulty apocalypse +25 (the max base difficulty), the hardest possible (un-modded) difficulty

**META** - Most Effective Tactic Available, is a very controversial term, due to just how many different build types there are. It's impossible to effectively compare a rolling build with a melee build - this causes common misuse, but the most common interpretation is that something is META if it can beat a 3-6 +25 trial
